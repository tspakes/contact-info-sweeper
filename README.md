Project to take comma separated values of phone numbers 
and email addresses as input and detect/print invalidities.

Input is assumed to be in the format of a text file containing
comma separated values. Acceptable values are phone numbers
and email addresses. A valid phone number is in the format
XXX-XXXX-XXX where each X is an arbitrary number between
0 and 9 inclusive. A valid email address is in the format
emailaddress@example.com with any finite amount of characters.
